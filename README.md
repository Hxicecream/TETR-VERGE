## What's VERGE?
VERGE allows you to scope out opponents and understand their playstyle, strengths and weaknesses. VERGE automatically generates a player's traits by analyzing their statistics and previous matchups. A key difference between VERGE and other TETR.IO tools is that VERGE displays these stats in-game. Instead of needing to tab to a different window and type a player's name to see their playstyle, VERGE allows you to view critical information with a single click.

## Features
- Displays:
	- A user's playstyle
	- What playstyles they win/lose against
	- Whether their stats are high/low relative to other players of similar skill
	- If they tend to win/lose after winning/losing
> [!TIP]
> Hovering over a trait displays additional information!
- Upcoming Features:
	- More customization!
	- Cloud saved Tetra League record
	- Cloud saved TETR.IO configuration
